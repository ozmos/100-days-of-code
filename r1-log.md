The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [October 1, Monday 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Joined the 100 days of code challenge.  Finished styling my react markdown previewer and deployed it to Github pages.  Now updating log using markdown which is a little ironic.

This seems an appropriate place to state some goals and reasoning behind joining this challenge:

1. I have a goal to start freelance developing by the end of the year (31/12/2018).  I think this challenge will help me progress mmore quickly towards this goal.
2. I feel my progress has slowed somewhat since starting full time work so I want to give my motivation a boost.
3. I enjoy seeing people's posts and progress on twitter and I'd like to join in properly rather than be an observer.

### R1D2
Worked through the redux tutorial on free code camp in the morning.  Continued this at night.  Also added a new video to my wife's website and made a mock-up of the drum-machine project for free code camp.
